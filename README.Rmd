# regexcite

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of regexcite is to provide simple string manipulation helpers. This package currently includes a function capitalize() to capitalize the first letter of each string in a character vector.


## Installation

You can install the development version of regexcite from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annasyt/regexcite")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(regexcite)

capitalize("hello")
#> [1] "Hello"

capitalize(c("apple", "banana", "cherry"))
#> [1] "Apple"  "Banana" "Cherry"
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
